      <h1>Why the Gorillaz?</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>
        Ever since I was a little kid of 6 to 7 years old, I've been listening to
        the Gorillaz. They are by far one of my favorite bands due to their unique
        musical style, art, animation, and the fact that the band members are
        literally just cartoon characters. I never could relate much to real people
        as a kid but these characters I always thought were really cool and their
        presence made the band just that much more awesome to me.
      </p>

      <div class="example-img">

      <h1>Why Feel Good Inc.?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Feel Good Inc. is perhaps one of, if not the, most popular songs by Gorillaz
        found on their Demon Days album. I know for sure that it's one of my favorite
        songs by them especially the part where the lead singer, 2D, starts to sing,
        "Windmill, windmill for the land." That very windmill he's referencing you
        can see floating in the background of this site!
        <br><br>
        I will admit though, I don't really know just what the song is about.
        I hope to find that out one day but for now I'll just keep enjoying enjoying
        it for what it is. Good music. Well, in my opinion anyways...
      </p>

      <h1>Top 5 Words</h1>
      <hr>

      <div id="table-wrapper" class="simple-bar">
        <table id="top-five-table">
          <tr>
            <th>Word</th>
            <td>sha</td>
            <td>ba</td>
            <td>da</td>
            <td>feel</td>
            <td>good</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Count</th>
            <td>48</td>
            <td>32</td>
            <td>32</td>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>15</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        I'm definitely not surprised that the words <em>feel</em> and <em>good</em>
        were in the top five words used in a song called Feel Good Inc.
        However, I had no idea that <em>sha</em>, <em>ba</em>, and <em>da</em>
        even counted as words in the lyrics! I just thought the lead singer was
        just making weird noises but it appears as though that wasn't the case...

      <h1>Data Structures and Wordclouds</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2 class="underline-title">HashMaps</h2>
      <p>
        I knew upon beginning this project that a HashMap was the best way to go.
        The reason is that HashMaps allow us to create a series of key/value pairs
        that can be accessed and updated on O(1) time so long as we know what the key
        is. This works great for we can simply iterate over the lyrics of a song using
        each word as a key that instantly maps to an Integer representing the number
        of times we've encountered it thus far. Had we used something like a List
        to track all our words and their frequencies we'd have to constantly iterate
        through it to find the right words to update along with having to manually
        handle adding in new ones if we've never seen them before! Java's HashMap
        class on the other hand allows us to quickly and easily update or add new
        words to the HashMap with its method put() by simply passing in the word
        as a key and what the new value should be. As such, I went with the HashMap
        due to its ease of use, amazing speed, and the fact that words and frequencies
        work well with the key/value philosophy that HashMaps work off of.
        <br><br>
        Regarding implementation, my class WordCounter makes use of a HashMap just
        as described above. It takes a file from the user and an optional regular
        expression then proceeds to read through the given file one word at a time
        converting each word to lowercase and filtering out any unwanted characters
        as dictated by the regular expression. Each word in turn is passed into the
        method incrementCounter() that then takes the word and either adds it to the
        HashMap called 'frequency' or, if it already exists, updates its associated
        value by 1. By the end, we have the frequency of every word from the song
        inside our HashMap all nicely bundled up and ready to use later in the
        application for when we create the wordcloud itself.
      </p>
      <h2 class="underline-title">Kumo</h2>
      <p>
        To create the wordcloud, I decided to make use of Kumo. Personally,
        I would rather try and create a wordcloud program from scratch but I don't
        have the time to do that. Plus, I wanted to challenge myself by setting up
        Maven and learning to include external dependencies. It took me an entire
        day of trial and error but I'm happy to say that I managed to get Maven
        up and running along with Kumo.
        <br><br>
        In order to make use of Kumo, I needed to find a way to supply it with
        all the lyrics and their frequencies from my chosen song. To do this,
        I first use a helper function inside my WordCounter class called exportWords()
        that creates an ArrayList called 'keyList' that is then populated with every key
        from the frequency HashMap. From there, we sort the keyList with the Collections.sort()
        method by passing in both the keyList and a lambda expression with the interface
        Comparator that uses the frequency HashMap to look up the word frequency of each
        key so that we can sort from highest to lowest. With that done, we write the
        results to a file called 'output.txt' in the output directory that will be used
        to build our wordcloud image.
        <br><br>
        Now that we have all the lyrics nicely sorted and formatted in
        such a way that Kumo can actually make use of them, we begin creating our
        wordcloud. To do this, we first start with two Kumo classes called
        FrequncyFileLoader and WordFrequency. We create a WordFrequency List by
        invoking the load() method from FrequencyFileLoader and passing in our
        output.txt with all the sorted lyrics as a File object. Next, we use the
        Kumo class WordCloud to create a WordCloud object by passing in a Dimension
        object with the size we want our final cloud to be and we pass in CollisionMode.PIXEL_PERFECT
        to set the cloud's collision mode.
        <br><br>
        With our wordcloud created, we then configure some extra details such as
        the cloud's padding, an image with transparency to define the shape, the
        color palette, and the size of the font. For the image, I have a file in
        the input directory called windmill.png that shapes the cloud into the
        silhouette of the floating windmill you can see in the background of the
        site. The color pallete is based off of the bands members from the Gorillaz.
        <br><br>
        Last but not least, we invoke the wordcloud's build() method by passing
        in our WordFrequencies List from earlier. This allows us to finally create
        the wordcloud we desire based on the settings we defined such as padding,
        image, etc. With all this done and out of the way, we invoke the wordcloud's
        writeToFile() method by passing in the name of our final image. Upon success,
        we now have our final wordcloud saved in the output folder named wordcloud.png!

      <h1>Improvements</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        If I had additional time, I would have attempted to recreate the quicksort
        algorithm for sorting the keyList instead of just using the Collections class.
        Not only that, I would have liked to attempt to create my own custom
        wordcloud software instead of just using Kumo. I also would have loved to try
        and create this site with Node.js and the PaaS called Heroku.
        <br><br>
        All in all though, I feel rather good about the project and enjoyed making
        it. I probably spent too much time on the website portion but I was having
        too much fun to stop.
      </p>

      <h1>Scaling</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        To scale the project even futher, I would continue to explore Maven and all
        that it offers. I noticed many features, such as the ability to run tests,
        that I would really like to learn how to use so that I can make a better,
        easier to maintain project.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the web side of things, I would make use of Webpack to help me better
        bundle and manage my project. Also, I made use of a JavaScript library called
        simplebar by using an external URL. This is bad for who knows when that link
        could go down and I am unable to develop my site without an internet connection.
        I'd fix this by making use of NPM to include simplebar in my project and
        also Browserify since I'm deploying to GitHub pages and would like to use
        the require() method to include simplebar in to my program.
