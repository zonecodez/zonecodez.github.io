        <h3>What data structure did I use?</h3>
        <p>I used a map because this was the best to relay the song lyrics along with their respective frequencies to the Kumo Library.</p>
        <h3>What improvements would you make if given more time?</h3>
        <p>Well, I haven't done any web development in a while and this assignment let me know exactly how rusty I've gotten. So if given more time I would invest more energy in some html, css and js practices to flesh out this website and make it more attractive and dynamic</p>
        <h3>How would you scale the project?</h3>
        <p>I would build a site creating wordclouds for the most popular songs of Will Smith, Jaden Smith and Willow Smith using pictures from their instagrams as templates for the clouds.</p>
        <h3>Why did you choose this particular song?</h3>
        <p>I chose Icon by Jaden Smith because this was his first major hit and I believe there will be many more to follow. Additionally, I was curious to see what words he used the most in a song that was so repetitive.</p>
        <h3>Was the song ever a Billboard top hit?</h3>
        <p>No, it was not.</p>
        <h3>What were the top words found? Was it a surprise?</h3>
        <p>The top word was "I" which I should have expected but it definitely caught me by surprise. I thought the top word was going to be "Icon". Most of all I am happy that I can figure this out for any song I want now.</p>
